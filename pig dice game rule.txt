There are two players, Each player takes turns rolling a pair of dice.
The total of the current player's roll is added to their score,
unless either die comes up as a "one". If this happens, this 
player's turn is over, and it becomes the other players's turn.
After each roll, the current player can either roll again(assuming a "one"
was not rolled)or if the current player feels that luck is running
thin, they can pass to the other player. The first player to get
30 points or higher wins.
If a player rolls two "ones" (snake eyes), that player's current
scrore gets zeroed out, and they have to start over, accumulating
points from zero.
